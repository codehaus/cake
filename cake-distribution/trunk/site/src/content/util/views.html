    <p>Resembling apaches commons collections or googles collection with some overlap
    
    A View defines a "virtual collection", 
    i.e., a description of  column selection filters (but with no permanent storage space allocated).
     When used in place of a table, a View selects the specified rows and/or columns from one or more real tables. 
    Views enable you to see complicated data tables in a more convenient format. 
     
     They also can be used as a security mechanism, by restricting user access to specific data. [See: 

Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table
# Views can hide the complexity of data; for example a view could appear as Sales2000 or Sales2001, transparently partitioning the actual underlying store
# Views take very little space to store; cake contains only the definition of a view, not a copy of all the data it presents
