    A view allows a datastructure such Collection, Set, Map, List to be viewed
    
    Views has very low memory overhead only containing the definition of the view.
    
    views are immutable, there is no way to change the definition of it.
    
    Views are often chained together to create a new 
    
    
     if the a new view is re
    
     
    in another way
     is read-only
    
    views can be transformed without effecting the underlying data structure
    Much like the the collection views available for java.util.Map j.u.Map
    
     which
 * allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
 * or set of key-value mappings.
 
 
    <p>Resembling apaches commons collections or googles collection with some overlap
    
	There are number of different views.
	
	Object view is probably the most common and is a view
	
	A view can be both have an order (a list), only contain unique values (a set).

    	View is a virtual view of a Collection/List/Set.
    A View defines a "virtual collection", 
    i.e., a description of  column selection filters (but with no permanent storage space allocated).
     When used in place of a table, a View selects the specified rows and/or columns from one or more real tables. 
    Views enable you to see complicated data tables in a more convenient format. 
     
     They also can be used as a security mechanism, by restricting user access to specific data. [See: 

Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table
# Views can hide the complexity of data; for example a view could appear as Sales2000 or Sales2001, transparently partitioning the actual underlying store
# Views take very little space to store; cake contains only the definition of a view, not a copy of all the data it presents

<h1 id="features">Element views</h1>
An element view is a collection of Objects, longs or doubles.


    
<h1 id="features">MapView</h1>
Mapviews are views of keys mapping to values.

<h1 id="features">MultiMapped views</h1>
A multimapped view is a views mapping from a key to a collection of values.
This support running map-reduce queries some powerful queries. Consider, for example,
An Object key mapping to a collection of Objects, longs or doubles.

Consider, for example, the person that we use in most examples.
