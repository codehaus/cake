    The Ops (org.codehaus.cake.util.ops) library is a are a collection of interfaces taking combinations of objects and primitives (primitives such as longs, doubles,..).
    Think of the interfaces as poor mans closures.
    </p>
    <p>
    Much of the complexity of this library stems from the fact that you cannot reify generics.
    Consider, for example, the Op interface
    
    list it...
    
    While it
    But cake aims to process millions of records in parallel. In which case relying on Op insteadof a special Longop can be 
    a magnitude slower. What's you new quad core good for then?
    </p>
    
  The name of the single method declared in each interface is simply <b>op</b> (short for "operate")

 BinaryOp Maps two arguments to a result. 
   <li> A <tt>BinaryOp</tt> maps two arguments to a result. Example: dividing two numbers
  
  <li>A <tt>Reducer</tt> is an <em>associative</em> binary op accepting and returning values of the same type;
  where op(a, op(b, c)) should have the same result as op(op(a, b), c). Example: adding two numbers.
  
  <li> Scalar binary ops accepting and returning the same type include their type name.
  
  <li> Mixed-type operators are named just by their argument type names.
  
  <li> A <tt>Generator</tt> takes no arguments and returns a result. Examples: random number generators, builders
  
  <li> A <tt>Procedure</tt> accepts an argument but doesn't return a result. Example: printing a value. An
  <tt>Action</tt> is a Procedure that takes no arguments.
  
  <li>A <tt>Predicate</tt> accepts a value and returns a boolean indicator that the argument obeys some property.
