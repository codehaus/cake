    The org.codehaus.cake.util.attribute package Attributes are an easy and type-safe way for 
    configuring properties for a service or attaching metadata to an object. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Lets say you want to expose a service that can configured 
    One you can solve this with the standard java libraries is by using Properties.
    Here a String key maps to a string value.
    
    Consider, for example,  
    </p>
   
    <p>An AttributeMap is an interface, similar to java.util.Map, used for storing attribute-value pairs. 
       That is one attribute (key) mapping to one value (possible null).

       The AttributeMap interface does not contain any mutable operations.
       MutableAttributeMap

	Sometimes it is needed to reference a specific attribute as a String.
	So, for example, to refer to COST attribute in cache entry you could write 
	org.codehaus.cake.cache.CacheEntry.COST
	Meaning, the attribute is the static field named COST in the class 
	org.codehaus.cake.cache.CacheEntry.
