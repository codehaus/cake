	<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

	Cake project consists of several modules:
	<ol>
		<li>cake-cache - the cache module</li>
		<li>cake-util - the util module</li>
		<li>cake-service - the module contains the documentation and assembles the src and bin distributions</li>
	</ol>
	When you checkout the trunk you'll get all the modules, but you can just add the module you are interested in to the URL, e.g.
		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co http://svn.codehaus.org/cake/[module]/trunk</pre></div>
	to checkout out the single module separately.
 -->
	<h2 id="browser">Web Access</h2>

	<p>You can use the browser to navigate within the sources <a href="http://svn.cake.codehaus.org/browse/cake/?%40hideEmptyDirectories=Y">online</a>
	with the help of the FishEye installation on Codehaus.</p>

    <h2 id="subversion">Subversion</h2>

    Cake uses Subversion as the SCM.  See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion website</a> for details and documentation on IDE integration.

	<h2 id="svn">Svnserve Access</h2>

	Svnserve access is via a specific port (Codehaus uses the default 3690).  This is often not allowed by corporate firewalls.
  
	<h3 id="svn-anon">Anonymous Access</h3>

		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co svn://svn.cake.codehaus.org/cake/trunks</pre></div>

	<h2 id="webdav">WebDav Access</h2>

	WebDav is an alternative access protocol supported by SVN and being http-based is often allowed by corporate firewalls.

	<h3 id="webdav-anon">Anonymous Access</h3>

		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co http://svn.codehaus.org/cake/trunks</pre></div>
		
		<p>
		You might also use this URL to <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/cake">browse the repository</a> in a simple manner.
		</p>

	<h3 id="webdav-auth">Committer Access</h3>

		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/cake/trunks</pre></div>

		<p>
		This access protocol is available to all, but only developers can commit changes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Developers require a LDAP password for Codehaus username (contact Bob at the Haus to get assigned a password if you don't have one).
		</p>
		<p>
		To test https commit access, one may e.g.:</p>
		<div class="Source"><pre>
svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/cake/trunks cake
cd cake
echo "test" &gt; TEST
svn add TEST
svn commit --username username --password your-password --message "Testing https"
		</pre></div>
		<p>
		<b>Note</b>: you only need to specify username and password once per client.
		</p>
