    <title>Cache Loading</title>
    <meta name="short" content="Loading"/>

   <p>
   Cache loading refers to the process whereby a cache transparently (lazy) load or generate values for requested key(s).
   This technique can often be more efficient then requiring a user to fill up the cache in advance. 
   A cache loader might load data from an external site, a databases or just a plain text-based file. 
   Data can also be generated on the fly, for example, as the result of a time consuming calculation.
   Finally, a cache loader can be used for prefetching, that is getting data into the cache well before it is needed.
   So data can be served immediatly when it is first requested, and thereby less latency for the users.
   </p>

   <h1 id="cache-loader">Cache Loader</h1>
   <p>
   A cache loader implementation is specified by the user before a cache is initialized and is responsible for 
   loading or creating the value for a specified key.
   </p>
   <p>
   	There are current two ways to create a CacheLoader:
   	1) Creating a simple function implementing the Op interface.
    2) Annotate a public method with the CacheLoader annotation.
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="op">Using the Op interface</h1>
  <p>
  The Op interface is used a lot in Cake and instead of creating a new interface we will use it here as well. 
  The interface takes a single argument which is the key that the user specifies when calling the get() method of a cache. 
  The return value of the method must be the value for which the cache should associate the specified key with.
  For example, if we want to create a cache the caches the result of a calculation in order to avoid repeating 
  the computations constantly we can define the following cache loader:
  </p>
  <div class="Source Java"><pre>
public class ComplexCalculation implements Op&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; {
    public Integer op(Integer i) {
				return i+i+i+i+i; //well maybe not that complex
    }
}
</pre></div>
  <p>
    We also need to tell the cache that it must use this loader, whenever no mapping exists for a key.
  </p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; conf = CacheConfiguration.newConfiguration();
conf.withLoading().setLoader(new ComplexCalculation());
Cache&lt;String, String&gt; cache = new SynchronizedCache(conf);
</pre></div>
  <p>
  Now when cache.get(1) is called the first time, the cache will use the ComplexCalculation instance to calculate 
  the value. But when cache.get(1) calling the second time, the cache will return the cached content instead of 
  calculating the value again.
  </p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
 // 1. hit - Uses the cache loader
System.out.println(cache.get(1)); // outputs 5

 // 2. hit - Returns the cached version
System.out.println(cache.get(1)); // outputs 5
</pre></div>

  <h3 id="op">Using the CacheLoader annotation</h1>
  <p>
  Instead of implementing the Op interface you can also annotate a method with the CacheLoader annotation.
  Which allows for parsing additional parameters between the user, cache and cache loader. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The first parameter of the method annotated with the CacheLoader annotations <b>must</b> be the key for which the user
  is requesting a value. It can be any non-primitive type. 
  The second parameter is optional and either be an AttributeMap or a MutableAttributeMap. If the second
  parameter is an AttributeMap the user and cache can provide additional arguments to the loader besides
  the actual key. If the second parameter is a MutableAttributeMap the cache loader can specify parameters
  back to the cache. 
  </p> 
   The specified key should contain enough information to allow the cache loader to retrieve the matching value. 
   The MutableAttributeMap can be be used by the cache to specify additional properties that the cache loader can use.
   It it also used by the cache loader to transfer metadata about the loaded value back to the caller. For example, the size of the value or the cost of retrieving the value.
   Simple cache loader will most likely just ignore the specified attribute map. 

   The following example shows a cache loader taking a String formatted as an url and retrieves the corresponding content as a String:
   <div class="Source Java"><pre>
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.URL;

import org.codehaus.cake.cache.service.loading.BlockingCacheLoader;
import org.codehaus.cake.util.attribute.MutableAttributeMap;

public class SimpleUrlLoader implements BlockingCacheLoader&lt;String, String&gt; {
    public String load(String key, MutableAttributeMap ignore) throws Exception {
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new URL(key).openStream()));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int str;
        while ((str = in.read()) != -1) {
            sb.append((char) str);
        }
        in.close();
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
</pre></div>
To create a cache that uses this cache loader, we use:
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration&lt;String, String&gt; conf = CacheConfiguration.newConfiguration();
conf.withLoading().setLoader(new SimpleUrlLoader());
Cache&lt;String, String&gt; cache = new SynchronizedCache(conf);

System.out.println(cache.get("http://www.java.net")); // 1. hit - Uses the cache loader
System.out.println(cache.get("http://www.java.net")); // 2. hit - Returns the cached version
</pre></div>
Now when cache.get("http://www.java.net") is called the first time, the cache will use SimpleUrlLoader to retrieve the web page. 
But when cache.get() is called the second time, the cache will return the cached content instead of retrieving the web page again.


<h1 id="features">Prefetching</h1>
Prefetching is the process of getting a value from an external location into the cache well before it will need it. 
An immediate example is prefetching the second page of a result set whenever a query is submitted by a user. 
In this way the cache can return the second page without any delay.
The CacheLoadingService interface supports a number of methods for doing this. 

<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.with().loading().load("http://www.wikipedia.org"); //will load the specified url only if it is not already present in the cache or if it needs refreshing 
cache.with().loading().loadAll(); // will reload all elements in the cache that is expired or needs refreshing
</pre></div>
Unless otherwise specified all methods are asynchronous and will return immediately. 

The cache loading service can also be used for refreshing/reloading existing entries. For example, if the content has expired
and you want the old content to available until 
<p>
but you want it to be available until it has been refreshed.
A number of methods starting with *load*, for example, load(K key), which will load the value if it is not already present in the cache or if it expired. The other group of methods starts with forceLoad* and will always load a new value even if valid one is already present in the cache. Unless otherwise specified the cache will load the values asynchronously.

Ordinary loading
Examples of various loading calls:

Will load the front of page of java.net into the cache if it is not already present. Or if an entry already exist
and a needs-reload-predicate has been configured and evaluates the existing to true. 
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.with().loading().load("http://www.java.net"); //will load the specified url even if it already present in the cache
</pre></div>
The next example only makes sense if a needs-reload-predicate has been defined. The example will reload 
and replace t


Calling loadAll () The next example will reload all entries in theeWill attempt to load
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.with().loading().loadAll();
</pre></div>

//(Ordinary) loading will only load the specified elements if they are either not present in the cache or needs refreshing
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.with().loading().load("http://www.wikipedia.org"); //will load the specified url only if it is not already present in the cache or if it is expired or needs refreshing 
cache.with().loading().loadAll(); // will reload all elements in the cache that is expired or needs refreshing
</pre></div>


<h1 id="forced-loading">Explicit loading</h1>
Data can also be asynchronoEntries 
Reloading will forcefully load entries even if a valid entry in already in the cache.
A forced CacheLoadingService can be obtained by calling cache.with().forcedLoading().

The first example, will load the front page of java.net into the cache even if it is already in the cache: 
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.with().loadingForced().load("http://www.java.net");
</pre></div>

This example shows how to reload <b>all</b> elements that are currently in the cache:
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.with().loadingForced().loadAll(); 
</pre></div>

Reloading of entries can easily be combined with cache filtering to reload parts of the cache. 
The last example, reloads all those cached web pages that have a size greather then 10 kB: 
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
cache.filter().onValue(new Predicate&lt;String&gt;() {
    public boolean op(String content) {
        return content.length() &gt; 10 * 1024;
    }
}).with().loadingForced().loadAll();
</pre></div>


    <h1 id="loading-faq">Loading FAQ</h1>
    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="no-state-date">How do I make sure that I am not serving stale data?</h2>
    <p>
    	One way is to schedule full reloads of cache every xx minute/hour. The reload
    	will be performed by a background thread and will not interfere with the response time of
    	users requests, except for any generally load that the full load might put on the system.
    	For example, this snippet will schedule a full reload of the cache every 15 minute.
    </p>
    <h2 id="no-full-reload">Full reloads uses to many resources on my system?</h2>
    <p>
        If a full reload uses to many of your systems resources. You can instead schedule partial
        reloads. The idea being that instead of, for example, reloading all your data every 15 minute, 
        you instead reload 1/15 of your data every minute. The effect is the same as full reload, but
        it is just better spread out over time. 
        For example, this snippet will schedule a partial reload that makes sure every part of the 
        cache is refreshed every hour.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="expiration-support">Is there any support for time based expiration of entries?</h2>
    <p>
    Currently there is no direct support for expiration of elements.
    But depending on your needs you can most likely emulate it rather easily.
    
     If by e
    	Not directly. But you can easily emulate.
    	
    	//Create Attribute and add it to cache
    	
    	//Setup scheduler
    	cache.filter().on(ExpiresAt, LongPredicates.lessThen(System.currentMillies)).clear();
    	
    	//insert entries, with expiration time.
