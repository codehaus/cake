      A MemoryStore is the in-memory-container where the cache stores all its cache entries. When
      a user requests a value for a particular key the cache checks its memorystore to see if it has a corresponding
      value. In which case it returns it to the user.

<h1 id="challenge">Disable Caching</h1>
<p>
  Sometimes it might be desirable to disabling the memory store. For example, if you are trying to
  track down a bug, and you suspect it might be stale data in the cache. In this
  
  when you are testing
</p>
<p>
Disabling the cache does remove any entries. If you want to remove all entries you can do so after disabling the cache by
invoking clear().
</p>
<p>
When you are want the start storing data that is cached you can enabled the memory store again by calling MSS.setEnabled(true) .

<h1 id="challenge">Controlling the size and volume of the cache at runtime</h1>
<h1 id="challenge">Trimming the cache manually</h1>
<p>
 Cache trimming is the process of evicting entries such that the cache upholds a certain size or volume.
 In all the above examples, the cache had required no interactions by the user.
 The size was kept down automatically.
 
 The downside to this is that the must maintaing ekstra bookkeeping state in order to decide which entries to evict.

    <h2 id="good-filtering-predicate">Why can´t I just specify that the cache m do I make sure my cached data are fresh?</h2>
    <p>
    	One way to make your data is fresh is to schedule full reloads of cache every xx minute/hour.
    </p>	
    <p>
    	You can also schedule partial reloads of the cache instead of full reloads. This might be 
    	usefull if you want to avoid overloading the source you fetching data from.
