    A filtered cache is the result of applying a predicate (boolean function) on every entry in a cache.
    Only those entries for which the predicate evaluates to true are retained in the filtered cache.
    The filtered cache is backed by the original cache, so changes to the original cache are reflected in
    the filtered cache, and vice-versa.
   </p>
   <!--
   <p>
    A filtered cache can be combined with almost all other cache operations, allowing:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Batch removal of all entries that evaluates to true for a .</li>
    <li>Updating only those entries that has some specific property.</li>
    <li>Reloading only those entries that hasn't .</li>
    <li>Returning a list of all those values with some specific property (querying).</li>
    </ul>
    -->
   <p>
    Consider, for example, the following cache definition:
   </p>
    <div class="Source Java"><pre>Cache&lt;String, Integer&gt; cache = new SynchronizedCache&lt;String, Integer&gt;&lt;();
cache.put("A", 1).put("B", 2).put("C", 3).put("D", 4);
System.out.println(cache); //Prints {A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4}
</pre></div>
   <p>
    To create a filtered cache we use the <code>cache.filter()</code> method on the Cache interface. In this case 
    we will create a filtered cache containing only those cache entries where the integer value is odd:
   </p>
   <div class="Source Java"><pre>
Cache&lt;String, Integer&gt; oddNumbers = cache.filter().onValue(new Predicate&lt;Integer&gt;() {
    public boolean op(Integer value) {
        return value % 2 == 1;
    }
});
</pre></div>
   <p>
   	The filtered cache we have created works as a normal cache instance with a few modifications 
   	that is listed in the FAQ later on this page.
   </p>
   <div class="Source Java"><pre>
System.out.println(oddNumbers.size()); //Prints 2
System.out.println(oddNumbers); // Prints {A=1, C=3}

oddNumbers.clear(); //Removes all entries with odd values.
System.out.println(oddNumbers); //Prints {}
System.out.println(cache); //Prints {B=2, D=4}, (only entries in oddNumbers was removed) 
</pre></div>    	
    <h1 id="cache-selector">Cache Selector</h1>
    <p>
    A <a href="http://cake.codehaus.org/apidocs/org/codehaus/cake/cache/CacheSelector.html">Cache Selector</a> is the 
    interface used for creating the actual filtered cache and it is obtained by calling <tt>cache.filter()</tt>.
    It consists of a number of methods all taking some kind of predicate that. 
    For example, 
     
    Its easy to create a filtered cache that like in the above 
    There are number of different properties that can evaluated some additional 
    ways for creating a filtered cache then just evaluating a property on the value part of a <code>CacheEntry</code>
    When calling  a  is returned.
    </p>
   <div class="Source Java"><pre>
List methods except primitive attributes

</pre></div>
Besides the methods listed here there are also additional methods that takes primitive attributes
and primitive predicates.

    <h1 id="limitations">Filtering and Views</h1>
    <p>
    Filtering is often used together with <a href="views.html">Cache Views</a> as a way of querying a cache. 
    For example, to create a list of all those keys having an odd value. You first create a filtered cache 
    selecting the elements, after which you create a view of the keys in that filtered cache:
   <div class="Source Java"><pre>
Cache<String, Integer> filtered = cache.filter().onValue(new Predicate&lt;Integer&gt;() {
    public boolean op(Integer value) {
        return value % 2 == 1;
    }
});
View<String> keys = filtered.keys();
List<String> keyList = keys.toList();
   </pre></div>

    <h2 id="good-filtering-predicate">What characterizes a good filtering predicate function?</h2>
    <p>
    A couple of things:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Consistent:</b> A predicate should always return the same truth value for equivalent elements.</li>
    <li><b>Fast:</b> Since the predicate is applied to each entry it must be very fast.</li>
    <li><b>Thread-safe:</b> The predicate supplied must be thread-safe so multiple threads can evaluate entries concurrently.</li>
    <li><b>Lock-less:</b> The predicate should not rely on locks.</li>
    <li><b>No side effects:</b>Invoking a predicate should not have any visible side effects.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="restrictions">Are there any restrictions on the cache created by a filtering operation?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes there are some restrictions, they may be lifted in future version, but for the time being there enforced by the cache.
      Add, Put, compute cannot insert into empty
 there are some strange situations.
    
    "A"->1, "B"->2, "C"->3, "D"->4
    if you call get("B") you would get null, so its fair
    . but since its backed
    
    
        Create, read, update, delete
        
    Even though it
    is still going to be added to the cache

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="overhead">How many filtered cache instances can I create?</h2>
    <p>
    As many as you want! Creating a filtered cache is a very fast operation with almost no memory overhead. 
    Basically a filtered view is just a single predicate holding the definition of the view and a reference 
    to the original cache. So you easily have thousands of views available at the same time. And since views 
    are immutable, you can share them among different threads.
    </p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="runtime-performance">Are there any performance issues when operating on a filtered cache?</h2>
    <p>
    It depends. While most filtered operations are just as fast as operation on a normal cache, others are somewhat slower. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Consider, for example, the <tt>cache.size()</tt> operation which normally is a constant time operation. 
    Internally a cache might keep a <tt>long sized</tt> field, which records the current size of the cache and 
    whenever a user invokes the size() operation on the cache, it can just return the value of the size field.
    However, since a filtered cache does not store anything physically except the predicate used for creating it.
    <b>Every</b> entry in the original cache must be evaluated each time the size() operation is called. 
    To see if the entry belongs in the filtered cache and therefore must be included in the total size of the filtered 
    cache.
    </p>
    <p>  
    Unless you invoke <tt>size()</tt> very frequently you will likely not experience any slowdown.
    If you have a small cache the cost of invocation the size() operation is fairly small, because there are only
    a limited number of entries that must be evaluated each time. If you have a large cache and are using a 
    multi-core processor the cache can use multiple threads to evaluate the size of the cache. 
    For example, if you have a quad core processor, the cache can split the entries up into four separate parts 
    and let each core calculate the size for one of the four part.
    The cache can then return the sum of the individual results from each core. 
    </p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->  
    <h2 id="series-of-filteres">Can I create a filtered cache from a filtered cache?</h2>
    <p>
    While series of filters are allowed, it is usually more efficient to combine them into single filters
    when possible. For example, <tt>cache.filter().onValue(isBlue).filter().onValue(isRound)</tt> is generally
    less efficient than <tt>cache.filter.onValue(isBlueAndRound)</tt>. Even though they are semantically equivalent.
