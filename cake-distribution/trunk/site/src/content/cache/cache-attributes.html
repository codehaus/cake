    <p>
    The CacheEntry interface extends the Map.Entry interface allowing flexible attachment of metadata such
    as creation time, hit count, and size to individual entries.
    </p>
    <p>
    Consider, for example, an application where you need to keep track of the creation time for each entry 
    in the cache. One way to do so would be to attach the information in the value part (entry.getValue()) 
    of the objects you insert in the cache. However, this would require you to change the class of every 
    object you put into the cache adding a field containing the creation time.
    </p>
    <p>
    An easier solution is to use the built-on functionality for attaching metadata to each entry in the cache.
    The following example configures the cache so it keeps track of the creation time for when
    an entry for a given key was first inserted into the cache.
    </p> 
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration<String, String> conf = CacheConfiguration.create();
conf.add(CacheEntry.CREATION_TIME);

Cache<String, String> cache = SynchronizedCache.from(conf);
cache.put("Test", "Test");
long creationTime = cache.getEntry("Test").get(CacheEntry.CREATION_TIME);
});
</pre></div>    	
     
   <h1 id="buildin-attributes">Build-in attributes</h1>
   <p>
   Build-in attributes, are attributes that have are treated specially by the cache.
   For example, if the cache has been configured to with the CreationTime attributes.
   It knows that it must add the creation time to the set of each entries attributes 
   when it is first created.
   </p>
   <p>
   The following list of build-on attributes are currently defined:
COST : The cost, in some arbitrary scale, of bringing the entry into the cache. 
HITS : The number of times the entry has been accessed through get operations.
SIZE : The individual size, in an arbitrary scale (for example bytes), of a cached value.
TIME_ACCESSED : The time when the entry was last accessed through get operations.
TIME_CREATED : The time when the entry was initially added to the cache.
TIME_MODIFIED : The time when the entry was last modified through put or replace operations.
VERSION : The number of times the entry has been modified through put or replace operations.
   </p>
   <p>
   To enable, for example, the version attribute and the time accessed attribute you just need to call:
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration<String, String> conf = CacheConfiguration.create();
conf.add(CacheEntry.VERSION, CacheEntry.TIME_ACCESSED);
</pre></div>        
   
   <h1 id="features">Used defined attributes</h1>
   <p>
   User defined attributes are attributes that are created by the user and that has no semantically 
   meaning to the cache. So, for example, instead of the cache implicit setting the creation time of an 
   entry when it is first inserted. The user must explicit set the value of user defined attributes whenever 
   an entry is created or modified.
   </p>
   <p>
   Consider, for example, a cache maintaining various documents and for some reason you need to keep 
   track of who has inserted each document.
   </p>
   <p>
     First you will need to the attribute under which the user should be stored. 
     In this case we store the owner as a single non-null String.
   </p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration<String, String> conf = CacheConfiguration.create();
conf.add(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE);
});
</pre></div>
   <p>
     Next, you need to tell the cache that it should store this attribute for each entry. Otherwise
     it will just ignore the entry whenever it is encountered.
   </p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration<String, String> conf = CacheConfiguration.create();
conf.add(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE);
});
</pre></div>    	
  <p>
  To set the owner for an entry you need to eksplicit set it when adding a new entry to the cache.  
  </p>
     <div class="Source Java"><pre>
Cache<String, String> c = SynchronizedCache.from(conf);
c.put("MyDoc1", "document_content", OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE.singleton("myusername"));

//Get the owner of a single document
String owner = c.getEntry("MyDoc1").get(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE);

//Get all documents for a specified owner.
List<String> mydocuments=c.filter().on(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE, Predicates.equalsTo("myusername").values().toList();
});
</pre></div>    	
    <h1 id="important-considarations">Cache Attribute FAQ</h1>
    
    <h2 id="restrictions">Why do I need to enable the attributes manually</h2>
    The main reason is avoid using to much memory, 
    Normally people uses caches when they have insufficient memory.
   We don't want to take away your precious memory. 
   Besides things as Access, Hit count can be somewhat expensive (and unnecessary if you are not using the features).
   Because they need to updated each time a user calls get().
   Filesystems such as ZFS also allows for disabling collecting of access timestamps.
    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="restrictions">Hits, Accesstime</h2>
    <p>
      For performance reasons the CacheEntry.Hits attribute and CacheEntry.Accesstime attribute are treated a bit special.
      Normally the attribute value of an attribute can only be updated when an entry is added to the cache
      or when it is updated, for examaple, from calls to replace(). However 

    Consider a read heavy cache, if we needed to create a new CacheEntry each time the entry was accessed
    to update the hit count or accesstime we would create a lot of object garbage.

    </p>
    <p>However, The hit attribute and the access time attribute is treated a bit differently.
    
    So a cache entry returned from 
    </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Idempotent:</b> It must be idempotent that is it should be consistent Since the predicate is evaluated for each entry it must be very fast.</li>
    <li><b>Fast:</b> Since the predicate is evaluated for each entry it must be very fast.</li>
    <li><b>Thread-safe:</b> The predicate supplied must be thread-safe so multiple threads can use the predicate at the same time.</li>
    <li><b>Lock-less:</b> The predicate should not rely on locks.</li>
    <li><b>Stateless:</b> The predicate should be stateless</li>
    <li><b>No Sideeffects:</b> The predicate should be stateless</li>
    </ul>
