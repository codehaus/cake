    <p>
    The CacheEntry interface extends the Map.Entry interface allowing flexible attachment of metadata such
    as creation time, hit count, and size to individual entries.
    </p>
    <p>
    Consider, for example, an application where you need to keep track of the creation time for a specific entry.
    One way to do so would be to attach the information in the value part of a objects you insert in the database,
    however, this would require you to change every class you put into the cache and a field containing the creation time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead you use caches funtionality for attaching attributes to each entry 
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration<String, String> conf = CacheConfiguration.create();
conf.add(CacheEntry.CREATION_TIME);

Cache<String, String> c = SynchronizedCache.from(conf);
c.put("Test","Test");
long creationTime = c.getEntry("Test").get(CacheEntry.CREATION_TIME);
});
</pre></div>    	
     
    </p>
     
   <h1 id="features">Build-in attributes</h1>
   <p>
   Build-in attributes, are attributes that have are treated specially by the cache.
   For example, if the CreationTime attribute has been enabled, the cache knows that it must
   set creation time whenever an entry is created.
   </p>
   <p>
   The following list of attributes are currently available:
COST : The cost, in some arbitrary scale, of bringing the entry into the cache. 
HITS : The number of times the entry has been accessed through get operations.
SIZE : The individual size, in some arbitrary scale (for example bytes), of a cached value.
TIME_ACCESSED : The time when the entry was last accessed through get operations.
TIME_CREATED : The time when the entry was initially added to the cache.
TIME_MODIFIED : The time when the entry was last modified through put or replace operations.
VERSION : The number of times the entry has been modified through put or replace operations.

   </p>
   <p>To enable, for example, the Version attribute and the Time created attribute you will
   
   
   
      A filtered cache view represents a subset of the data contained in a cache.
      For example to create a cache view, all those cache entries where the string key starts with 'https'

   <h1 id="features">Used defined attributes</h1>
   <p>
   User defined attributes are attributes that are created by the user and that has no semantically 
   meaning to the cache. So, for example, instead of the cache implicit setting the creation time of an 
   entry whenever it is first inserted. The user must explicit set it whenever an entry is created or modified.
   </p>
   <p>
   Consider, for example, a cache maintaining various documents and you only want to allow the owner of
   these documents to be able to modify them.
   </p>
   <p>
     First you must create the attribute that will hold the definition if the user. In this case we store the owner as a
     single non-null String.
   </p>

   <p>
     Next, you need to tell the cache that it should store this attribute for each entry. Otherwise
     it will just ignore the entry whenever it is encountered.
   </p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
CacheConfiguration<String, String> conf = CacheConfiguration.create();
conf.add(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE);
});
</pre></div>    	
  <p>
  	To set the attribute of an 
  Whenever you insert or modify entries in the cache you will need to specify the value of the attribute.
  
  And then add it to the cache like any other attribute
  </p>
     <div class="Source Java"><pre>
Cache<String, String> c = SynchronizedCache.from(conf);
c.put("MyDoc1", "blablabla", OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE.singleton("myusername"));

//Get the owner of a single document
String owner = c.getEntry("MyDoc1").get(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE);

//Get all documents for a specified user.
List<String> mydocuments=c.filter.on(OwnerAttribute.INSTANCE, Predicates.equalsTo("myusername").values.toList();
});
</pre></div>    	
    <h1 id="important-considarations">Cache Attribute FAQ</h1>
    
    <h2 id="restrictions">Why do I need to enable the attributes manually</h2>
    The main reason is avoid using to much memory, 
    Normally people uses caches when they have insufficient memory.
   We don't want to take away your precious memory. 
   Besides things as Access, Hit count can be somewhat expensive (and unnecessary if you are not using the features).
   Because they need to updated each time a user calls get().
   Filesystems such as ZFS also allows for disabling collecting of access timestamps.
    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="restrictions">Hits, Accesstime</h2>
    <p>
      For performance reasons the CacheEntry.Hits attribute and CacheEntry.Accesstime attribute are treated a bit special.
      Normally the attribute value of an attribute can only be updated when an entry is added to the cache
      or when it is updated, for examaple, from calls to replace(). However 

    Consider a read heavy cache, if we needed to create a new CacheEntry each time the entry was accessed
    to update the hit count or accesstime we would create a lot of object garbage.

    </p>
    <p>However, The hit attribute and the access time attribute is treated a bit differently.
    
    So a cache entry returned from

<ul>
    <li><b>Idempotent:</b> It must be idempotent that is it should be consistent Since the predicate is evaluated for each entry it must be very fast.</li>
    <li><b>Fast:</b> Since the predicate is evaluated for each entry it must be very fast.</li>
    <li><b>Thread-safe:</b> The predicate supplied must be thread-safe so multiple threads can use the predicate at the same time.</li>
    <li><b>Lock-less:</b> The predicate should not rely on locks.</li>
    <li><b>Stateless:</b> The predicate should be stateless</li>
    <li><b>No Sideeffects:</b> The predicate should be stateless</li>
    </ul>
