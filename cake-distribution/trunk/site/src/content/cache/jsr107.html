   <p>
	   Currently cake does not support the Jsr 107, but we might support it sometime in the future.
	   Even if we might support it at some time, we still recommend using the Cake API for anything
		 but very basic cache needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Besides the fact that it has been under developement in more then 8 years (yes, no typo) there are
		number of shortcommings with the API that we believe.
	</p>	
  <p>		
		The api looks very much as the same api when first in 2001, and API design has come a long way since.

   	Cake supports a number of wrappers so if you are already 
   	using an existing caching framework such as OSCache, EHCache or Infinispan.
   	You can easily replace the underlying implementation with cake.
   	Since Cake doesn't support 
   	And if you decide to continue using Cake you can easily gradually convert to the api.
