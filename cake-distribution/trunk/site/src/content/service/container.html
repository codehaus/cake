    <p>
    The Container interface provides 2 kinds of functionality.
    1) Looking up services that has been registered in the container.
    2) Starting and stopping the container and the services registered within the container.
    </p>
    <p>
    Normally the Container interface is extend with an interface providing additional domain specific functionality.
    For example, the Cache interface which specifies methods for insertion and retrievel of data. But inherits
    the methods for starting, stopping and looking up services from the Container interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    Containers can be arranged in a hierachy so services register in one container
    can be available in multiple child containers. This is useful, for example,
    sharing a single ThreadPool among multiple containers.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    </p>	
    
    For example, if you shutdown a container that has any children, all its
    children will also be shutdown. 
    
    When a user tries to look
    up a service 
    If a specific service is not found in a container
    it will automatically look in the parent container (if it has one). The parent 
    might look in its parent and so on.
    
    Instead you create a parent container that is shared among all cache instances

    <h1 id="features">Single Container</h1>
      A single container is a container that has no parent or child containers.

    initialized
    starting
    running : Normal state
    shutdown
    terminated 
    
    Once stopped you cannot restart a container.
