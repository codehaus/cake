   	Cake has a simple service model that 
   	allows easy integration between cake components and user provided components.
    Its not aiming to replace frameworks such as Spring or Guice. However, 
    it provides a solution for small containers.
    

   	I 
   	for integration user components and services with various cake containers and their lifecycle
   	that can be used for bla bla holding services and controlling their lifecycle

    There are two kinds of services:
    <ul>
      <li>Internal services that Looking up services that has been registered in the container.</li>
      <li>User defined services that Starting and stopping the container and the services registered within the container.</li>
    </ul>
    is provided by containers.
    
    Services can either be built-in services
    or user defined services.
    
    can be 
    
    <h1 id="features">A simple service</h1>

    <h1 id="runafter">RunAfter - lifecycle integration</h1>
    <p>
    The RunAfter annotation can be used to integrate the lifecycle of a container with your components.
    You can annotate methods that you want to run whenever a container transitions from one state to another.
    For example, if you want to start some scheduled jobs after the a container has started and stop it again

  This is a list of services that are available from all container implementation
  ExecutorService
  Clock
  ScheduledExecutorService
  ClassMonger <- The ClassMonger interface is used by the container 
                 to load and create classes at runtime
