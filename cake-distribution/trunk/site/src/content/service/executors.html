    <p>
    The Container interface server two primary purposes:
    <ul>
      <li>Looking up services that has been registered in the container.</li>
      <li>Starting and stopping the container and the services registered within the container.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Normally the Container interface is extended with an interface providing additional domain specific functionality.
    For example, the Cache interface which specifies methods for insertion and retrieval of data. Inheriting
    methods for starting, stopping and looking up services from the Container interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    Containers can be arranged in a hierachy so services register in one container is available from child containers. 
    This is useful, for example, for sharing a single ThreadPool among multiple containers in order to reduce the number
    of threads that need to be created. 
    </p>
    <h1 id="features">Single Container</h1>
      A single container is a container that has no parent or child containers.

    <h1 id="lifecycle">Container Lifecycle</h1>
      The container parses through five different phases:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Initialized.</b> This is the initial state of the container.</li>
        <li><b>Starting.</b> The container is in the process of starting up, but has not fully completed startup of all services.</li>
        <li><b>Running.</b> The container has been started with success (normal state).</li>
        <li><b>Shutdown.</b> The shutdown method has been called on the container, and the container is in the process of shutting down all its services.</li>
        <li><b>Terminated.</b> All services has been been shutdown. The container is fully shutdown and cannot be restarted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="initialized">Initialized</h1>
    <h3 id="initialized">Starting</h1>
    <h3 id="initialized">Running</h1>
    <h3 id="initialized">Shutdown</h1>
    <h3 id="initialized">Terminated</h1>
    
    <p>
    Besides explicitly starting a container by calling .
    All containers will be started automatically whenever methods are invoked.
    For example, calls to #getService.
    <p>
    <p>Looking up a service</p>
    <h1 id="features">Service registration</h1>
    Containers 

    <h1 id="features">Build-in services</h1>
    Build-in services a services that a available from a container without any user intervention.
    There are 3 types of services that available from almost any container 
    ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService, ForkjoinExecutor. 
    
    If you want to provide your own services you can just override the existing services.
    For example, lets  
    <h1 id="features">Hirachy Containers</h1>
    Hic containers are.
    
    If you arrange containers. Starting the parent container will first start the parent
    container, after it has been fully started all of its child containers will be started.
    
    When shutting down a parent container. The parent container container will first shutdown all
    child containers (why wait on services in the child container being shutdown).
    The only being that a parent is never terminated before all child containers are terminated 
    
    <p>
    
    Lifecycle.... see for Lifecycle.hmtl for complete details



    The lifecycle methods  
    For example, if you shutdown a container that has any children, all its
    children will also be shutdown. 
    
    When a user tries to look up a service 
    If a specific service is not found in a container
    it will automatically look in the parent container (if it has one). The parent 
    might look in its parent and so on.
    
    Instead you create a parent container that is shared among all cache instances
