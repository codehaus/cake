    <p>The Ops package is a are a collection of interfaces taking combinations of objects and primitives (primitives such as longs, doubles,..)</p>
  The name of the single method declared in each interface is simply <b>op</b> (short for "operate")
 
   <li> A <tt>BinaryOp</tt> maps two arguments to a result. Example: dividing two numbers
  
  <li>A <tt>Reducer</tt> is an <em>associative</em> binary op accepting and returning values of the same type;
  where op(a, op(b, c)) should have the same result as op(op(a, b), c). Example: adding two numbers.
  
  <li> Scalar binary ops accepting and returning the same type include their type name.
  
  <li> Mixed-type operators are named just by their argument type names.
  
  <li> A <tt>Generator</tt> takes no arguments and returns a result. Examples: random number generators, builders
  
  <li> A <tt>Procedure</tt> accepts an argument but doesn't return a result. Example: printing a value. An
  <tt>Action</tt> is a Procedure that takes no arguments.
  
  <li>A <tt>Predicate</tt> accepts a value and returns a boolean indicator that the argument obeys some property.
