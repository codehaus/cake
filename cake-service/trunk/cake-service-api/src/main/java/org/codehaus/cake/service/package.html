The main interface in the package 

<p> The package can be roughly divided in two sections:</p>
<ul>
    <li> <p><i>A Low Level API</i>, which deals with the following abstractions:</p></li>

    <ul>
      <li><p><i>Addresses</i>, which are networking identifiers, like IP addresses.</p></li>
      <li><p><i>Sockets</i>, which are basic bidirectional data communication mechanisms.</p></li>
      <li><p><i>Interfaces</i>, which describe network interfaces. </p></li>
    </ul>
    <li> <p><i>A High Level API</i>, which deals with the following abstractions:</p></li>

    <ul>
      <li><p><i>URIs</i>, which represent Universal Resource Identifiers.</p></li>
      <li><p><i>URLs</i>, which represent Universal Resource Locators.</p></li>
      <li><p><i>Connections</i>, which represents connections to the resource pointed to by <i>URLs</i>.</p></li>
      </ul>
