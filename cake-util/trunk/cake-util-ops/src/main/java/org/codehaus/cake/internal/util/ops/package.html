Provides implementations of various ops. The primary reason for placing these classes in an internal package.
Is to avoid the clutter of all these class definitions in a public api. As an alternative classes could have been
declared package private, however, in some cases we want access to the internals of an op. For example,
we might want to get hold of the 2 predicates an orPredicate is wrapping.
